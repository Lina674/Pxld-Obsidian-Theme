This Obsidian theme is available on desktop and is heavily inspired by pixelated games. It features the Pixel Square font and both dark and light modes. This theme is highly customizable: the font and the accent colors can be modified to the user's liking.

In order to customize the theme, move the `pixel_custom_font.css` into the snippets folder in `.obsidian`. The Style Settings plugin is required.

If the Pixel Square font is not recognized, download the `Pixel Square 10.ttf` file on your machine, right-click on it, and select "Install for all users". This should make the font available.
